# LOOK.md — what NOCTIS is supposed to look like

This is the third governing document, beside `CONTRACT.md` and `STATE.md`.

`CONTRACT.md` says what a session may not do. `STATE.md` says what has been
done. Neither says what the city is *for*, and for ten sessions that absence
has meant every session optimised proxies — luminance bands, cluster counts,
claim areas — because those were the only written targets. This file is the
target.

**A session that satisfies every gate and does not move the city toward this
document has not succeeded.**

## 1. The city

**A dense night city in 2049.** Not a ruin, not a utopia, not a cyberpunk
pastiche. A working metropolis that has kept building for twenty-five years.

The density reference is **lower Manhattan**: streets walled on both sides for
their whole length, buildings meeting the pavement with no gaps, no visible bare
ground between them. Sky is something you see a strip of, looking up.

The mood reference is **rain-lit neon at street level** — the class of image
where the road is a mirror and every light counts twice.

## 2. Density — what it concretely means

The single largest gap between NOCTIS today and the reference is not detail.
It is that the street wall is broken.

- **Buildings meet the lot line.** A block's frontage is continuous. Where a
  parcel is empty, it is empty *for a reason* — a yard, a site, a park — not
  because a noise field came out low.
- **Fill approaches 1.0 in the core.** Measured at session 31: 23 of 100 chunks
  carry zero buildings, one of them at density 0.715. That is the defect.
- **Heights are lognormal, not an even comb.** Mostly six to twelve storeys,
  with occasional towers standing well clear. `citygen.js` already carries the
  argument and both measured arms: sd/mean 0.664 against today's 0.425, p99
  134 m against 65.
- **Density has causes.** A river, a viaduct, an elevated railway with stations
  — the city already has all four and nothing reads them. Land by water and by
  transit gets built tall and to the line. Land under a viaduct gets sheds and
  yards. A station mouth concentrates frontage around it. A city generated from
  noise looks generated however dense it is.

## 3. Light

Light is the city's main material. Geometry is what the light lands on.

- **Neon.** Large, and often vertical. Today's signs are small horizontal plates
  high on facades; the reference has signs four storeys tall, several at
  different depths in one frame, some spanning half a wall.
- **Holograms.** Emissive, semi-transparent, above the street and at junctions.
  New content, not yet present in any form.
- **Colour opposition.** This is close to free and it is the biggest unspent
  lever. NOCTIS is currently monochrome amber — nearly every emitter is warm.
  The reference works because cold cyan fights warm sodium in the same frame.
  A third of emitters should be cold.
- **Wet streets.** The road reflecting its own light sources is what makes a
  dark frame read as full of light rather than empty. See §6 — this is already
  built.
- **Light at pavement height.** Shopfronts, stall lamps, bus shelters, pillar
  faces. A pedestrian should be lit by something at their own level, not only
  silhouetted.

## 4. The street at eye level

The camera that matters is a person standing on the pavement. Everything here
is judged from about 1.7 m.

- **Crossings.** Marked crossings at junctions, with signals pedestrians
  actually use. Currently absent and conspicuous by it.
- **Parks and planting.** Green in a dense city is punctuation — small squares,
  a strip of trees, a fenced garden between two blocks. Parks exist as a block
  type; they read as dark empty ground at night.
- **Layered depth.** Three planes in every frame: a dark foreground shape, a lit
  mid-ground, a hazed distance. Frames with only two planes read flat.
- **Variation over repetition.** The market stalls are the current failure case
  — one form, ten in a row, varying only in canopy colour. Any object placed at
  intervals needs form variation, not colour variation.
- **Things that are near are detailed.** Vehicles and people are what a walker
  gets close to. Architecture can stay coarse. Session 31 measured that per-class
  vehicle shape already costs zero extra draw calls via row instancing — the box
  cars are an authoring gap, not a budget one.

---

## 5. What NOCTIS is not

- Not a Blade Runner reproduction. Reference, not target.
- Not a ruin or an abandoned city. It is busy.
- Not photoreal. Flat-shaded, deliberately. The look comes from light, colour
  and density — not from polygon count or texture detail.

---

## 6. Already built, never seen

`weather.js` implements wet film, puddle roughness, Fresnel reflectance for
water and a screen-space reflection gate. `ssr` defaults to 1.

**`wet` defaults to 0.** Every frame in this project's history — every gate
frame, every screenshot in every STATE — is a dry street.

    localhost:5173/?player=1&wet=1&t=0.0

Before anything in §3 is built, this needs looking at, because it may already
deliver a large part of it.

## 7. How this document relates to the gates

The gates were derived against earlier versions of this city. Several of their
thresholds now measure a city that no longer exists:

- the 6.00% bright-reserve floor, derived under a camera veil session 27
  removed, and since excluded by three independent mechanisms;
- `band:noon`, whose margin is smaller than its own run-to-run spread;
- 76 of 189 bounds with no recorded derivation at all.

**A look threshold is evidence, not a verdict.** When a change moves the city
toward this document and moves a look band the wrong way, the correct response
is to ask what that band was derived from — not to abandon the change.

That is not permission to tune thresholds green. It is a statement about which
document wins: this one describes the goal, and the gates measure proxies for
it. A proxy that now argues against the goal is a proxy that needs re-deriving,
in the open, with the reason and the date written down.

The occupancy registry is a different matter and keeps its authority: nothing
may stand inside anything else, whatever it looks like.

## 8. How to use this

Sessions should cite the section they are serving. A session brief that cannot
name one is probably instrument work, and instrument work now needs a reason.

Edit this file when the picture changes — it is the operator's document, and
anything here he disagrees with is wrong by definition.
